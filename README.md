You live, you build terrible projects which should never see the light of day,
and -- if you're very lucky -- you learn something from that experience.

This repo contains that middle chunk -- projects I built which should never see
the light of day, but which I feel like I should keep world-readable for
whatever reason.

For the love of all that is good in this world, I recommend against reading
through this code. Your eyes will bleed.
