# puppet
Way back when, I managed my dotfiles across my systems with Puppet Modules. Now
I'm not saying that was a bad idea (it was a bad idea), but I'd like to think
I've realized the error of my ways since then.

I wrote a bunch of modules back then, and I was hoping to just nuke them,
but... well, I threw them onto the Puppet Forge and some crazy people seem to
have taken to using them.

Each of those projects now exist as sub-folders in this repo. I have no
intention to continue maintainance on them and highly recommend using other
modules which do the same thing but better and with active maintainance --
consider this a read-only mirror for posterity.
